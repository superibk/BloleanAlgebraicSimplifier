# BloleanAlgebraicSimplifier
This is an android project that simplify all form of Boolean expression. 

This project use all the algebraic boolean expression in simplification of the expression

```
** The 12 Rules of Boolean Algebra **
* A + 0 = A
* A + 1 = 1
* A 路 0 = 0
* A 路 1 = A
* A + A = A
* A + A' = 1
* A 路 A = A
* A 路 A' = 0
* A'' = A
* A + AB = A
* A + AB = A + B
* (A + B)(A + C) = A + BC
Also, Demorgan's Theorems was used;

* (XY)' = X' + Y'
* (X + Y)' = X'Y'
